# YoMoPie - A Smart Metering Board for Raspberry Pi

The YoMo project aims to empower people using low-cost open hardware smart meters in their household.
With YoMoPie, we provide a Smart Metering extension board for Raspberry Pi.

The YoMoPie builds [on the work published in [1]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00450-014-0290-8#/page-1). The board integrates several sensors such as an energy metering IC, a relay to control connected loads, and an interface for RF communication.
